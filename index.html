          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <li>I am a PhD student in Software Engineering at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) currently nearing the end of my first year. 
              I am supervised by Yulei Sui from UTS and Shiping Chen from Data61.
              Currently I am working on static analysis for large programs and incomplete programs. 
              My interests generally lie in compilers and static analysis. 
              As a client of static analysis, I am interested in application security, and Iâ€™d like to explore the application of machine learning to pointer analysis. 
              I completed my bachelors in Computer Science with Honours at the University of New South Wales in 2017.</li>
